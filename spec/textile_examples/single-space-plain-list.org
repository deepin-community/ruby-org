** Anatomy of a BVP

   Each BVP followed a simple, one-page template with the following
   parts:
   
   - Customer Summary
   - Storyboard
   - Requirements
   - Partner teams

   The following sections walk through each section and give an
   example from one of our BVPs, [[http://windows/hyper-v/initiatives/Value Propositions/DynamicDatacenter-ValueProp.docx][Resource-Smart Virtualization
   Infrastructure]] (also called /Dynamic Datacenter/).
